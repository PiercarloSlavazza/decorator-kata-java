Overview

This repo contains Java code that allows to execute a code kata aimed at learning the Decorator Pattern.
How to execute the Kata

Execute the Unit Tests in the main branch: 3 of them won't pass.

You must make them pass by adding the missing implementations using the Decorator Pattern (and you also have to change the factories in the tests).

You can confront your code with a possible solution that is provided in the branch eco_friendly_footer_solution (that makes pass 2 out of the 3 failing tests).
Visitor Pattern

Beware! In order to make pass one of the 3 tests, you must also use the Visitor Pattern.
